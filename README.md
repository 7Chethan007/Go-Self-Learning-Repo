### Emanuals Directory

The `emanuals` directory contains the first project I did to learn Golang.
This project is part of the Coursera course "Backend Web Development with Go: Build an E-Manual Server," which I audited. You can find more details about the course and the guided project on Coursera:

### Course Objective

In this 1.5-hour long guided project, you will create a web server that serves electronic manual pages with Golang's built-in packages. Go (also known as Golang) is a programming language that is created, supported, and used by Google and many major organizations. It is particularly suitable for internet applications thanks to its ready-to-use packages. We will cover serving HTML contents with HTTP protocols, as well as preventing malicious access with regular expressions. This course is aimed at learners who are proficient with core Golang (variables, data types, flow control, functions, packages) and have experience with HTML. Knowledge of HTTP protocol is helpful but not required. "Golang for Beginners: Data Types, Functions, and Packages" is highly recommended as a prerequisite.

### Learning Objectives

- Serve static resources using Go's http package
- Serve web pages using Go's html templates
- Create a web server using Go's http package
